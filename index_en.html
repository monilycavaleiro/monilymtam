  <h2>Literary Universes: Worlds That Defined a Generation</h2>
  <p>
    The 2000s represented a decisive moment for fantasy literature, marked by the
    consolidation of so-called literary universes. Unlike standalone narratives,
    these universes are structured as complex worlds with their own rules,
    internal mythologies, genealogies, maps, and stories that unfold across
    multiple books.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this period, fantasy moved beyond niche audiences and began to engage
    directly with the general public. Reading became a long-term immersive
    experience, encouraging continuous engagement and emotional connections
    between readers and fictional characters and settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The popularization of these universes also reshaped the relationship between
    literature and other media, paving the way for film adaptations, television
    series, cultural products, and online communities, further strengthening
    fantasy’s presence in contemporary culture.
  </p>

  <h2>When Fantasy Took Over Pop Culture</h2>
  <p>
    The turn of the millennium marked a turning point in how fantasy was socially
    perceived. Previously associated mainly with escapism, it came to be
    recognized as a genre capable of addressing complex themes such as power,
    identity, ethics, coming of age, and social conflict.
  </p>
  <p>
    Authors of the 2000s expanded the boundaries of the genre by exploring morally
    ambiguous characters, politically dense narratives, and sophisticated
    storytelling structures. Fantasy thus became a privileged space for symbolic
    reflections on the real world, even when set in imaginary realms.
  </p>
  <p>
    This movement contributed to the formation of a highly engaged generation of
    readers who not only consumed the works but actively participated in debates,
    theories, fan productions, and cultural events. Fantasy therefore established
    itself as one of the pillars of 2000s pop culture, deeply influencing the
    publishing market and the collective imagination.
